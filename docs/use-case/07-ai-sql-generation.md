Task: AI-Powered SQL Generation
=================================
**Introduction**: This use case covers using AI to generate SQL queries from natural language descriptions.

**Purpose**: Allow users to create queries by describing what they want in plain language rather than SQL syntax.

**Importance**: Optional

**Sub-Task**: 

 * Accept natural language query description
 * Generate corresponding SQL query using AI
 * Allow editing of generated query
 * Execute generated query
 * Provide feedback loop to improve AI generation

**Resources**:

 * Users describe what they want to query in natural language, and the AI generates the corresponding SQL.
 * The system leverages the database schema to generate accurate and optimized queries.
