# ADR N: brief decision title 

Describe here the forces that influence the design decision, including technological, cost-related, and project local. 

## Decision

Describe here our response to these forces, that is, the design decision that was made. State the decision in full sentences, with active voice ("We will...").

## Rationale 

Describe here the rationale for the design decision. Also indicate the rationale for significant *rejected* alternatives. This section may also indicate assumptions, constraints, requirements, and results of evaluations and experiments.

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
If deprecated, indicate why. If superseded, include a link to the new ADR. 

## Consequences

Describe here the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed, not just the "positive" ones.
